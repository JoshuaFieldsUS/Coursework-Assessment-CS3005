This is a Unity Platform Game


Hello! This Unity Platform Game was far too large to  fit into a GIT repository, so I have included a text file that contains two google drive links that will take you to both
the video explanation of the game and the folder containing the game itself. When extracting, please remember to download the entire folder and not just the game .exe . The 
game folder is named 'OOF My Mixtape Game' and can be scene from the link provided.

Happy Gaming!
